This repository contains an Azure Policy which can be used to automatically tag virtual machines behind a load balancer or application gateway. To make it work you need to create a custom role defined in the Roles folder and create a managed identity with the Tag Contributor and Reader Role. When creating the policy replace the placeholder in the policy definition with the created role id. When assigning the policy to a scope enter the id of the managed idenitity you created.
